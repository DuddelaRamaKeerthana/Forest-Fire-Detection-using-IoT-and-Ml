# Forest-Fire-Detection-using-IoT-and-Ml
Welcome to the Forest Fire Detection Using IoT and ML project! This project aims to develop an intelligent system that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to detect forest fires at an early stage, thereby reducing potential damage and increasing response times.
